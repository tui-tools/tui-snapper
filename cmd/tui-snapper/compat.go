// has actually run against, the caveats that apply to a range — come from the
// repository's own tool.json, embedded in the binary, so there is no second
// copy of them in the code.

// It never fails: a backend the manifest does not describe, a manifest that
// cannot be parsed and a missing binary all produce the zero Result, which the
// header renders as nothing at all.
